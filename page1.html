		<h2>The Heading</h2>
		<p class="text">This is a html based webpage created by Deepesh for the submission in repository (can't say if I spelled it correctly) in Github which I'm trying to learn with the help of Abhishek Panday. We are (me and Abhishek) also gonna attach a file (named as testyyy) with it using the CMD which is (the file) created by Abhishek. Last day I was talking to Abhishek on Phone and I don't really know what was we were talkling about but it turned into github homemade lacture like who's gonna waste so many days if you can learn it within a few hours also in very easy language. I saw an opportunity of learning and Abhishek was ready to help a friend out. But that's not the it, when it started I understand that its not an easy task to learn something new its like catching a flying arrow with your butt. But I had to catch that flying arrow with my butt in order to learn it and I had to learn it since the selections are already started. In the beginning everything was tough and hard to understand like i ain't gatting no shit mate, but at the end of the day I learned that its all about practice. Maybe I won't be able to everything but that's fine by me. As we Indian say<b> something is better than nothing.</b>  So yeah I learned something new. Anyway its day2 and it is supposed to be end today (or we just might take some extra classes on weekends maybe just to keep the thing in hand cause we are thinking of working on Python in order to understand the backend technology. </p>
